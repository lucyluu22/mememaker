// This file serves as a central hub for re-exporting pre-typed Redux hooks.
// These imports are restricted elsewhere to ensure consistent
// usage of typed hooks throughout the application.
// We disable the ESLint rule here because this is the designated place
// for importing and re-exporting the typed versions of hooks.

import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux"
import type { AppDispatch, RootState } from "./model/store"

// Use throughout your app instead of plain `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
export const useAppDispatch = useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()
export const useAppSelector = useSelector.withTypes<RootState>()

// So this kinda breaks the feature sliced design pattern?
// But its a small compromise to make the DX better... and I think its worth it.
